## Allowed in Materials Phases Only (08-09, 13)

These terms are permitted in the persuasive register but must still be anchored to evidence.

| Term | Rule |
|------|------|
| we / our / us | Permitted for first-person framing |
| opportunity | Can be used without "potential" qualifier |
| unique position | Must be followed by cited evidence within the same paragraph |
| compelling | Must be followed by cited evidence within the same paragraph |
| significant opportunity | Must be followed by market sizing data with citation |
| competitive advantage | Must reference specific evidence from competitive analysis |
| momentum | Must reference specific trend data with citation |

## Exception Rule

**Any prohibited word is allowed if it appears inside quotation marks as part of a direct quote from a cited source.**

Example: Kate Pierce described the situation as "desperate" for rural hospitals without nearby alternatives (Senate HSGAC testimony, March 2023).

The exception applies only when:
1. The word is inside quotation marks
2. The quote has a named speaker or source
3. The source has an inline citation

Paraphrasing a source while using a prohibited word does NOT qualify for the exception. The prohibited word must be the source's own language, directly quoted.
