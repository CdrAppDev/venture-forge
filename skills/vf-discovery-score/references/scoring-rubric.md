# Discovery Scoring Rubric

## Dimension 1: Funding Certainty (25 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 21-25 | Program is active with published solicitation, open applications, or confirmed upcoming cycle. Official documentation available. |
| 16-20 | Program exists and has funded similar efforts, but current cycle not yet announced. Strong historical pattern. |
| 11-15 | Program announced but details incomplete. Or program exists in adjacent area. |
| 6-10 | Program rumored or in legislative pipeline. Funding source inferred from agency priorities. |
| 0-5 | Speculative. Based on trends or analogies, not documented programs. |

## Dimension 2: Problem Clarity (25 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 21-25 | Problem is explicitly stated by funders with specific affected populations, quantified impact, and clear success metrics. |
| 16-20 | Problem is well-defined with identified populations and documented impact, but success metrics are funder-inferred, not explicit. |
| 11-15 | Problem area is clear but specific pain points or affected populations are vague. Funding targets a broad domain. |
| 6-10 | Problem is implied by the funding category but not articulated. Requires significant interpretation. |
| 0-5 | No clear problem statement. Funding is general-purpose or administrative. |

## Dimension 3: Timing (15 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 13-15 | Application deadline within 6 months. Or new program with first cycle opening soon. |
| 9-12 | Application deadline 6-12 months out. Or recurring program with reliable annual cycle. |
| 5-8 | Timeline unclear but program is active. Or deadline passed recently, next cycle expected. |
| 0-4 | No clear timeline. Program in early stages or legislative pipeline. |

## Dimension 4: Magnitude (15 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 13-15 | Total funding potential exceeds $500K across bundled sources. Multiple independent sources. |
| 9-12 | Total funding potential $100K-$500K. At least 2 independent sources. |
| 5-8 | Total funding potential $25K-$100K. Or single large source with uncertain access. |
| 0-4 | Small amounts (<$25K) or highly uncertain total. |

## Dimension 5: Competition (10 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | Narrow eligibility criteria that few applicants can meet. Or new program with low awareness. |
| 6-8 | Moderate competition. Program receives applications but success rates are reasonable (>10%). |
| 3-5 | Highly competitive. Well-known program with many applicants (success rate <10%). |
| 0-2 | Extremely competitive or gatekept. Requires existing relationships or track record we don't have. |

## Dimension 6: Venture Potential (10 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | Clear path to a venture that addresses the funded problem. Identifiable customers with budget and buying authority. |
| 6-8 | Plausible venture but customer acquisition path unclear. Or market exists but competitive. |
| 3-5 | Venture possible but business model uncertain. One-time project risk. |
| 0-2 | Funding supports pure research or services with no venture path. |

## Composite Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Recommendation |
|-------------|---------------|
| 80-100 | **Pursue** — Strong opportunity, prioritize for Phase 01 |
| 60-79 | **Investigate** — Promising but needs validation on weak dimensions |
| 40-59 | **Monitor** — Keep on watchlist, revisit when timing or certainty improves |
| 0-39 | **Pass** — Does not meet threshold for Phase 01 investment |
