# Phases 03-12: Add section layouts as phase skills are built.
# Every phase must include at minimum: hero, narrative, gate-review, sources.
#
# Narrative rules (apply to all phases):
# - Every phase narrative has exactly 4 chapters
# - The last chapter is always "The Ask" — pointing to Gate Review
# - Every factual claim links to its third-party source with source name label
# - Chapters 1-3 tell the story specific to the phase
# - The narrative exists for human decision-makers, not as documentation
#
# Writing governance (skills/vf-write):
# - Research phases (01-07): analytical register — data-first paragraphs, descriptive headlines, no first person
# - Materials phases (08-09, 13): persuasive register — story-first, evidence-anchored, first person allowed
# - Build phases (10-12): technical register — specification-first, no marketing language
# - See skills/vf-write/references/presentation-fidelity.md for narrative rendering rules
