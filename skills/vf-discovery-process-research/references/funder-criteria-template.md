# Funder Criteria Template

Generated `funder-criteria.md` files must match the format Phase 01 (Capital Thesis) expects. This template is derived from the CyberShield Rural input that successfully drove Phase 01.

## Required Format

```markdown
# {Opportunity Name} - Funder Criteria Input

## Known Funding Sources

### 1. {Primary Funding Source}
- {Program details: type, amount, agency, alignment}
- {Eligibility notes}
- {Timeline if known}

### 2. {Secondary Funding Source}
- {Details}

### 3. Additional Sources (Need Research)
- {Sources identified but not deeply researched}
- {Each with a note on why they may be relevant}

## Target Vertical
- {Primary vertical}
- {Specifically: target customer segment}
- {Company base and market scope}

## Geographic Focus
- Company based in {location}
- Target customers {market description}

## Known Context
- {Key problem indicator with data point if available}
- {Market signal or trend}
- {Regulatory driver if applicable}
- {Customer pain point}
```

## Minimum Requirements

A funder-criteria.md file must contain at minimum:
1. At least 1 known funding source with program name and amount range
2. Target vertical with customer segment
3. Geographic focus (company base and target market)
4. At least 2 known context data points about the problem space

## Quality Notes

- Include data points from the research (statistics, trends) in Known Context
- List funding sources in priority order (strongest alignment first)
- "Additional Sources (Need Research)" section is valuable — Phase 01 research will investigate these
- Do not fabricate funding amounts or eligibility criteria not found in research
