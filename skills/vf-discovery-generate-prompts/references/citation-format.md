# Citation Format Block

Include this block in every research prompt to ensure consistent, verifiable sourcing.

```
For every claim, provide a citation in this format:
- **Source:** [Publication or organization name]
- **Date:** [Publication date or "Accessed YYYY-MM"]
- **URL:** [Direct link to the source]
- **Relevance:** [One sentence on why this source matters]

If a data point cannot be verified with a credible source, state "Unverified - requires confirmation" rather than omitting it or presenting it as fact.
```
