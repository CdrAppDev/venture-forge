# Venture Profile

Platform-level input for Phase 00 (Opportunity Discovery). Discovery agents scan funding sources against this profile to surface funded problems across all verticals. Runs periodically to find new opportunities as the funding landscape changes.

## Scope

- **All verticals** — healthcare, fintech, edtech, cybersecurity, govtech, climate, logistics, legal, HR, real estate, agriculture, defense, insurance, construction, manufacturing, retail, travel, media, telecom, biotech, nonprofit/social impact, AI/ML, and any other sector with funded problems
- **All business models** — B2B, B2C, B2B2C, D2C, marketplace, platform, API-as-a-service, usage-based, subscription, freemium, transactional
- **All entity types** — for-profit, non-profit, public benefit corporation, B-corp
- **All stages** — pre-idea through growth, with emphasis on early stage (pre-seed, seed, Series A)
- **All geographies** — US-based companies; funding sources from federal, state, regional, and private
- **All solution types** — discovery does not filter by solution type. Downstream design phases (using first principles and jobs-to-be-done theory) determine the solution approach.
