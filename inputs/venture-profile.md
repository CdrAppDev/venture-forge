# Venture Profile

Platform-level input for Phase 00 (Opportunity Discovery). Describes what kinds of ventures the platform operator wants to build. Discovery agents scan funding sources against this profile to surface opportunities.

## Verticals

Priority verticals for venture creation:

- **Healthcare technology** — rural health, telehealth, compliance, cybersecurity, claims processing, remote patient monitoring, behavioral health access
- **Cybersecurity** — critical infrastructure protection, healthcare security, small/rural organization defense
- **Government technology** — civic tech, public health informatics, rural services delivery

## Geographies

- **Company base:** South Carolina, USA
- **Target markets:** US nationwide with rural focus
- **Funding geography:** Federal programs (national), South Carolina state programs, Southeast regional programs

## Team Capabilities

- Full-stack software engineering
- AI/ML development (LLMs, agents, automation)
- Healthcare domain knowledge
- No hardware manufacturing capability
- No wet-lab or biotech capability

## Stage Preferences

- **Funding types (priority order):** Non-dilutive grants first, accelerator programs, angel investment, pre-seed/seed equity
- **Grant range:** $25K–$2M per award
- **Equity range:** Pre-seed to seed ($100K–$2M)
- **Timeline:** Must be fundable within 12 months of discovery
- **Revenue target:** First revenue within 6 months of MVP build

## Constraints

- Software-only ventures (SaaS, platform, API)
- Must address a validated, evidence-backed problem
- Must have identifiable early customers (not speculative markets)
- Ventures must be buildable with AI-accelerated development (small team, high velocity)
- Regulatory compliance required where applicable (HIPAA, FedRAMP, SOC 2)

## Scan Parameters

Sources to monitor for funding opportunities:

### Federal Programs
- grants.gov — new grant announcements
- SAM.gov — contract and grant opportunities
- SBIR.gov — Small Business Innovation Research programs (HHS, NSF, DOD, DOE)
- NIH Reporter — National Institutes of Health funding
- Congressional legislation creating new funding pools (recent acts, appropriations)

### State and Regional Programs
- SC Research Authority (SCRA) — grants and investments
- SC Department of Commerce — economic development programs
- SC Launch — startup acceleration
- Southeast regional economic development programs
- State-level health IT and cybersecurity initiatives

### Private and Institutional
- VC firms with healthcare, cybersecurity, or govtech thesis
- Accelerator program announcements (Y Combinator, Techstars, MassChallenge, domain-specific)
- Corporate innovation programs (health systems, insurance companies, defense contractors)
- University research commercialization programs

### Policy and Regulatory Signals
- New federal legislation creating funding (e.g., RHTP, CHIPS Act equivalents for health/cyber)
- Regulatory enforcement increases that create market demand (HIPAA, CISA directives)
- Executive orders directing agency spending
- State-level policy changes affecting healthcare or cybersecurity

## Exclusion Criteria

Do not surface opportunities that:
- Require hardware development or manufacturing
- Are restricted to organizations with existing federal contracts (8(a), HUBZone only)
- Require matching funds exceeding $50K
- Are limited to non-profit or academic institutions only
- Target markets outside the US
- Require clinical trials or FDA approval
