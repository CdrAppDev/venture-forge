# Process Changelog

All notable changes to the Venture Forge process will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-28

### Initial Release

**12-phase process established:**

1. Capital Thesis
2. Problem Thesis
3. Market Thesis
4. Competitive Thesis
5. Solution Thesis
6. Business Thesis
7. Risk Thesis
8. Materials Assembly (combined from previous Case + Narrative)
9. MVP Architecture
10. MVP Build
11. Customer Traction
12. Funding Execution

**Key decisions:**

- Capital-first approach: start with funder criteria, work backwards
- Customer voice from research: mine forums, reviews, discussions instead of interviews
- Revenue as validation: ship MVP, get $1 revenue, then iterate
- Evidence-backed: every claim requires third-party citation
- Explicit gate outcomes: proceed / revise / kill at each phase

**Changes from prior draft (13-phase):**

- Merged "Case Assembly" and "Narrative Assembly" into single "Materials Assembly" phase
- Added explicit gate outcomes (proceed/revise/kill) to all phases
- Codified customer voice extraction as research requirement, not interview requirement
