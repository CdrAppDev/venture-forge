# Stage-appropriate expectations for pre-product venture funding

Pre-product ventures face a fundamental evaluation paradox: they're asked to demonstrate potential without traditional proof points. **The most important finding across all evaluator types is that pre-product standards are explicitly—not implicitly—lower**, with grant agencies, VCs, and accelerators publishing formal acknowledgments that preliminary data, revenue, and detailed projections are not expected at earliest stages. The critical distinction is between evaluators who fund visions (YC, angels, SBIR Phase I) versus those requiring working products (500 Global, many domain accelerators).

This research synthesizes published criteria from federal grant programs, named VC firms, major accelerators, and academic studies on angel decision-making to establish concrete benchmarks for what "good enough" means before product-market fit.

## What pre-product ventures can realistically produce

### Capital thesis quality before traction relies on insight, not evidence

At pre-product stage, a capital thesis must articulate **why now**, **why this team**, and **why this approach**—without the luxury of customer validation data. Published evaluator frameworks reveal that pre-product thesis quality is measured by clarity of thinking rather than comprehensiveness of proof.

**Sequoia Capital's published pitch guidance** states: "It wasn't really the slides we liked—it was their ideas, the clarity of their thinking, and the scope of their ambition. We love to partner early—when an idea is newly formed and has the maximal room to grow."

A realistic pre-product capital thesis should contain four components: a crisp problem statement with evidence the problem exists (not that your solution works), a "why now" timing thesis explaining why this moment enables the solution, a team narrative demonstrating founder-market fit, and a commercialization pathway showing you understand how businesses in this space make money. **Three-to-five year financial projections are explicitly not expected**—a16z partner Justine Moore writes that "it's often difficult to model forward-looking financials for early stage companies" and recommends focusing on "key milestones you're looking to hit in the coming 12-18 months."

### Pitch materials expected without product or revenue

The data on pitch deck viewing is stark: **investors spend an average of just 2 minutes 24 seconds** reviewing decks, with pre-seed decks receiving slightly more attention at 4 minutes 10 seconds. Successful pre-seed decks generate 4+ minutes of viewing time; unsuccessful ones receive approximately 1 minute 30 seconds.

For pre-product pitch materials, the research establishes clear "include" and "exclude" categories:

**Essential sections (92% of successful decks include "Why Now?"):**
- Cover slide with one-sentence company purpose
- Problem statement (data-backed, specific, urgent)
- Solution approach (unique, not over-engineered)
- "Why Now?" timing thesis
- Market size (bottom-up approach, realistic SAM/SOM)
- Business model (one primary model, clear pricing logic)
- Team slide (relevant experience, complementary skills)
- Funding ask with milestone-based use of funds

**Acceptable validation substitutes when no product exists:**
- Customer interview quotes
- Letters of intent (LOIs)
- Waitlist numbers
- Survey/research results demonstrating demand
- Advisor commitments
- Accelerator acceptances
- Pilot agreements (even if pre-product)

### Funding sources realistic before product-market fit

Different evaluator types have dramatically different stage requirements. Based on published criteria:

| Evaluator Type | Accepts Idea-Stage | Requires MVP | Notes |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------|-------|
| Y Combinator | ✓ | — | "We fund companies with no revenue, product, or fully baked idea" |
| Techstars | ✓ | — | "Ideas hashed out on a piece of paper" accepted |
| Angels | ✓ | — | 16x more likely to fund seed ventures than VCs |
| SBIR Phase I | ✓ | — | "Preliminary data are not required" |
| 500 Global | — | ✓ | "Functional prototype before investing" required |
| Most Fintech accelerators | — | ✓ | Working MVP typical requirement |
| Corporate accelerators | — | ✓ | Often require "in-market or ready to market" |

## "Good enough for this stage" standards

### Published guidance from evaluators differs significantly by type

**Federal grant reviewers** operate from explicit rubrics. The NIH's new simplified framework evaluates Factor 3 (Expertise and Resources) as a **binary sufficient/insufficient** determination rather than a scored criterion—designed to "reduce potential for general scientific reputation to have undue influence." This formally accommodates first-time applicants without track records.

For NIH SBIR Phase I applications, the official reviewer guide specifies:

| Element | Phase I Requirement | Phase II Requirement |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Preliminary data | NOT required | Expected (Phase I results) |
| Commercialization plan | Not required | Required (15 pages max) |
| Budget guideline | ~$100K | ~$750K |
| Duration | 6-12 months | Up to 2 years |

**DoD SBIR** ranks evaluation criteria explicitly: (1) Technical Merit and Innovation, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, (3) Commercialization Potential—in descending order of importance. Phase I commercialization strategy is limited to approximately one page in the Technical Proposal.

**NSF SBIR** uses three evaluation criteria: Intellectual Merit, Broader Impacts, and Commercial Impact.

### Evaluation criteria change dramatically across stages

First Round Capital's analysis of 300 companies over 10 years provides quantitative data on what predicts seed-stage success:

- Companies with at least one female founder performed **63% better**
- Teams with average age under 25 performed **30% above average**
- Founders from top schools performed **220% better**
- Teams with at least one founder from Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, or Twitter performed **160% better**
- Teams with more than one founder outperformed solo founders by **163%**
- Repeat founders received **50% higher valuations** but didn't significantly outperform first-timers

- Relevance: Quantitative analysis of 300 companies revealing actual predictors of seed success

**Academic research** on angel decision-making reveals fundamentally different evaluation approaches. The Maxwell et al. (2011) study of 150 real investor-entrepreneur interactions found that angels use "elimination-by-aspects" heuristics—if an opportunity has a "fatal flaw," it is rejected immediately without weighing other factors.

- URL: Academic journal
- Relevance: Foundational peer-reviewed research on actual angel decision processes

**Experienced angels are explicitly skeptical of financial projections.** Mason & Rogers (1997) found that finance is the most important criterion for novice angels but ranks only 4th for experienced investors. The Sudek (2006) study found top angel investment criteria ranked: (1) trustworthiness of entrepreneur, (2) quality of management team, (3) enthusiasm of lead entrepreneur, (4) exit opportunities.

### What experienced investors consider "impressive for stage"

**Table stakes (minimum viable materials):**
- Well-structured pitch deck (10-15 slides)
- Clear problem statement
- Basic team information
- Rough market sizing
- Understanding of competitive landscape
- Simple cap table
- One-sentence company purpose

**Impressive for pre-product stage:**
- Demonstrates deep understanding of why current solutions fail
- Innovative approach that challenges current paradigms
- Letters of support from potential customers (though not required)
- Clear, specific milestones with defined success criteria
- Team with complementary technical AND business expertise
- Evidence of customer discovery conversations
- Specific Phase III pathway or transition partner identified (for SBIR)

Paul Graham's published guidance on YC applications describes the "most important question" as: "Please tell us in one or two sentences about something impressive that each founder has built or achieved." Type doesn't matter; **magnitude matters**: "Succeeding in a startup is, in the most literal sense, extraordinary, so we're looking for people able to do extraordinary things."

### Where grant reviewers and equity investors diverge

| Dimension | Grant Reviewers (SBIR) | Equity Investors (Angels/VCs) |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Primary focus | Technical feasibility | Team quality and coachability |
| Market validation | Can be theoretical | Prefer customer evidence |
| Financial projections | Not required Phase I | Simple model expected |
| IP status | Important for Phase II | Less critical pre-seed |
| Timeline expectations | 6-12 months Phase I | Flexible |
| Commercialization | Pathway, not proof | Business model clarity |
| Prior track record | "Appropriate for career stage" | Signals matter but not required |
| Evaluation style | Scored rubrics (1-9) | Holistic, often intuitive |
| Risk reduction | Ex ante (before funding) | Angels reduce risk ex post |

The Van Osnabrugge (2000) study of 40 interviews and 262 questionnaire responses found that angels reduce agency risks **after** investment while VCs reduce agency risks **before** investment—fundamentally explaining different evaluation criteria and due diligence depth.

## Over-engineering signals and when thoroughness becomes a red flag

### Funding materials that are premature at pre-product stage

**a16z explicitly advises against including in early-stage data rooms:**
- Detailed 3-5 year financial projections ("we don't expect a fully-baked model")
- Org charts and team bios (they use LinkedIn)
- Tax returns, audits, and legal documents
- Board meeting minutes
- Market sizing documents (they do their own analysis)

### Financial detail suggesting planning over learning

The research identifies specific signals that founders are over-investing in planning rather than customer discovery:

**Over-engineering signals:**
- 40+ tabs in Excel financial models
- Revenue projections segmented by product line, region, AND customer segment
- Sophisticated cohort analysis before product launch
- Monthly precision for years 3-5
- Complex cap table modeling with multiple scenario analyses
- Platform-specific marketing budgets before any marketing tests
- Detailed product roadmaps beyond 12-18 months

**Appropriate pre-product financial model:**
- 3-year annual projections (not monthly)
- Focus on cash position, burn rate, and runway
- Unit economics concept (not proven metrics)
- Simple assumptions clearly stated
- One primary business model (not multiple revenue streams)

The Vitalize VC partner perspective: "Some VCs don't think pre-seed and seed companies should be doing financial models, but I think that founders who deeply understand their business will naturally want to spend the time... Projections help me learn how a founder thinks."

- URL: https://www.docsend.com/blog/4-types-of-documents-founders-must-have-in-their-fundraising-data-room
- Relevance: VC perspective balancing need for financial thinking vs over-modeling

**The core principle from research:** Angels know projections will be wrong—"you are lucky to come in within a factor of two at the end of year one. Years 3-5 are pure fantasy." The purpose of projections is demonstrating thinking, not accuracy.

### When data room thoroughness becomes a red flag

**For pre-launch companies, a16z states a data room "typically includes a deck, information on your team, and a roadmap for what you'd like to accomplish before the next round."** Any additional documentation is reactive—add documents as investors request them.

**Data room red flags across sources:**
- Overly complex cap tables with "dead equity" or too many early stakeholders
- Information inconsistent with pitch deck numbers
- Over-documentation suggesting planning instead of building
- Missing or outdated financials that were included (better to exclude than have stale data)
- Multiple unfocused problems suggesting scattered approach
- Extensive legal/corporate structure documentation too early

**Pre-seed data room checklist (from PitchDrive):**
1. Pitch deck
2. Team bios (brief)
3. Basic financials (burn rate, runway only)
4. Product mockups or vision document
5. Market research summary (not comprehensive study)
6. Cap table (simple, current state)
7. Customer validation evidence (whatever exists)
8. Legal basics (incorporation only)

| Element | Successful Decks | Unsuccessful Decks |

- Market size based on founder insight rather than purchased research
- Competition analysis limited to 3-5 alternatives
- Financial projections at annual granularity only
- No exit strategy slide (described as "amateurish" at pre-seed)
- No detailed product roadmap beyond 12-18 months
- Single use-of-funds breakdown (not detailed line items)

**Universal pre-product red flags (causes immediate rejection):**
- "We have no competitors"
- Inconsistent numbers across materials
- Poor grammar/typos
- Unable to clearly explain what company does
- Contract developers handling all technical work
- Unfair equity splits among founders
- Part-time founders seeking validation rather than committed

Michael Seibel (YC CEO) identifies "tarpit ideas" as a key red flag: "Very common ideas many have tried without success." Additionally, bad traction is worse than no traction: "A bad traction slide is worse than no traction slide."

## Conclusion: Key calibration principles

**The core finding is that "good enough" at pre-product stage is explicitly defined by evaluators—not guessed at.** NIH states preliminary data are not required for Phase I. YC states they fund companies with no product or fully baked idea. a16z explicitly advises against detailed projections in early-stage data rooms. These are not inferences; they are published positions.

The key calibration principles for pre-product materials are:

1. **Team quality substitutes for traction.** Across all evaluator types, team capability and trustworthiness are the primary evaluation criteria when product evidence is unavailable.

2. **Timing thesis substitutes for market proof.** The "Why Now?" section appears in 92% of successful pre-seed decks because it explains conviction without requiring validation data.

3. **Insight substitutes for experience.** Paul Graham's guidance emphasizes demonstrating extraordinary achievement in any domain—not specifically startup experience.

4. **Simplicity signals focus.** Over-engineering (detailed projections, complex cap tables, extensive data rooms) is interpreted as misplaced priorities rather than thoroughness.

5. **Stage-appropriate honesty is expected.** PitchDrive's guidance: "At pre-seed stage, investors aren't expecting a perfect business. They know you're still figuring things out. What they do want is honesty."

Where specific stage-appropriate standards are not explicitly published by evaluators, this research notes the limitation. The calibration presented here is based on primary sources where available and clearly marked as inferred from adjacent evidence where direct documentation was not located.
