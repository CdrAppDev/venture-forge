# Quality standards for AI-assisted funding expert outputs

**Strategic funding expertise means distinguishing between investors who might theoretically fund a venture and those who will realistically engage—then executing with evidence that survives professional scrutiny.** This report synthesizes federal grant rubrics, VC frameworks, accelerator criteria, and data-backed pitch research to define what "good" looks like across three critical phases of venture funding. For pre-product, pre-revenue ventures specifically, quality standards emphasize team credibility, market validation methodology, and narrative consistency over premature revenue metrics.

## Phase 01: Capital thesis quality standards

The capital thesis phase determines whether a venture pursues the right funders with realistic expectations. Research reveals that experienced practitioners differentiate between superficial funder lists and rigorous alignment analysis through specific methodological markers.

### Funder identification: quantity versus strategic fit

**Good:** Identifies **20-40 aligned funders** ranked by stage match, sector focus, geographic fit, and current fund capacity. Excludes VCs whose fund is closing, those who've backed direct competitors, and investors who haven't led deals at the relevant stage within 180 days.

**Bad:** Lists 100+ funders scraped from databases with equal weight, includes growth-stage VCs for pre-seed ventures, or claims "any investor" is a target.

**Benchmark:** Mark Suster (Upfront Ventures) recommends starting with approximately 40 qualified investors filtered by fund size alignment (VCs typically allocate no more than 5% of fund per deal), recent deal activity, and sector focus. Visible.vc guidance suggests maintaining a pipeline of 50+ targeted investors given typical conversion rates.

- **Relevance:** Data-backed investor guidance from active VC with two decades of fundraising experience on both sides

### Criteria documentation: surface-level versus actionable intelligence

**Good:** Documents specific evaluation criteria each funder uses with primary sources—investment thesis statements, partner blog posts, portfolio pattern analysis. Notes variations by vertical (healthcare funders require regulatory pathway clarity; climate funders evaluate environmental impact metrics).

**Bad:** Copies generic "what VCs look for" lists without funder-specific validation; assumes all early-stage investors have identical criteria.

**Benchmark:** NSF SBIR explicitly scores three distinct criteria: Intellectual Merit, Broader Impacts, and Commercial Impact. NIH uses a 1-9 scale across Significance, Investigator(s), Innovation, Approach, and Environment. DoD prioritizes (in order) technical merit, team qualifications, then commercialization potential.

- **Relevance:** Official government evaluation framework showing criteria vary significantly by agency

### Alignment path: realistic versus aspirational

**Good:** Maps specific requirements to current venture capabilities with identified gaps and timelines for closing them. For pre-product ventures, demonstrates how team credentials, preliminary customer validation, or technical milestones satisfy "traction" expectations appropriate to stage.

**Bad:** Assumes meeting criteria is simply a matter of better pitch deck language; ignores fundamental mismatches between venture stage and funder requirements.

**Benchmark:** First Round Capital explicitly seeks founders with "compelling and contrarian insight"—not just relevant experience. Sequoia requires markets "on the path to $1B potential." For federal grants, NIH explicitly states "preliminary data are not required" for Phase I SBIR, but Approach receives the highest predictive weight for funding decisions.

| Funder Type | Minimum Market Size | Stage-Appropriate Traction |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Major VCs (Sequoia, a16z) | $1B+ TAM | Contrarian insight + team credentials |
| Seed-stage VCs | $100M-1B TAM | MVP or validated prototype |
| SBIR Phase I | Defined commercial application | Technical feasibility demonstration |
| Angel investors | More flexible | Trust + founder passion + exit path |

- **Relevance:** Canonical VC framework defining market size thresholds

### Timeline understanding: documented versus vague

**Good:** Documents specific funding cycles—SBIR solicitation windows, VC fund deployment timelines, accelerator application deadlines with months-in-advance relationship building. Notes that NSF Phase I decisions take 5-7 months post-submission; typical VC raises take **12 weeks** with founders pitching approximately **58 investors** on average.

**Bad:** Treats fundraising as always-available; doesn't account for VC fund lifecycle (avoid VCs about to close funds), SBIR annual solicitation schedules, or accelerator batch timing.

### Capital thesis anti-patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Looks Right | Why It's Strategically Weak |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| "We have no competition" | Sounds like differentiation | VCs hear "no market" or "founder hasn't done research" |
| Targeting 100+ funders | Looks like comprehensive effort | Dilutes focus; signals spray-and-pray approach |
| Listing brand-name VCs only | Appears ambitious | Stage mismatch wastes time; Tier II VCs often better seed partners |
| "Our customers are everyone" | Sounds like large market | Signals lack of segmentation understanding |
| Corporate VC as lead investor | Prestigious names | Strategic baggage complicates future rounds; save for Series B+ |

## Phase 08: Materials assembly quality standards

The materials assembly phase transforms venture strategy into investor-facing artifacts. Research demonstrates that pitch materials succeed or fail based on specific, measurable characteristics—not subjective polish.

### Evidence compilation: verified versus assumed

**Good:** Every market size claim uses bottom-up analysis with documented methodology. TAM/SAM/SOM framework applied with specific customer segment identification. Financial projections tie explicitly to assumptions. Traction metrics include retention cohorts, not just vanity metrics.

**Bad:** Market sizing quotes single analyst report ("$50B market, we just need 1%"); financials use hockey-stick projections without underlying assumptions; traction emphasizes downloads without engagement data.

**Benchmark:** DocSend analysis of 320 pitch decks found **58% of successful decks included financials versus 0% of failed decks**. For pre-revenue ventures, acceptable evidence includes: waitlist signups, Letters of Intent, customer interviews, technical milestones achieved, pilot users, or design partner commitments.

- **Relevance:** Largest dataset tracking correlation between deck elements and funding outcomes

### Narrative consistency: integrated versus disconnected

**Good:** Problem → solution → traction → business model → ask flows as coherent story. Same metrics appear consistently across deck, executive summary, and data room. Headlines alone convey complete narrative.

**Bad:** Statistics contradict between slides; business model appears at slide 10 instead of slide 4; traction metrics change between documents.

**Benchmark:** DocSend found successful decks position business model **4th** in presentation order; unsuccessful decks position it **10th**. Successful founders insert "Why Now?" section early after company purpose. Investors spend only **2 minutes 30 seconds** on average reviewing decks—headline-first structure is essential.

- **Relevance:** Analysis of 3,000 pitch decks with 8 million data points

### Citation standards for pre-product ventures

| Claim Type | Citation Required | Acceptable Evidence |
|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Market size | Yes | Bottom-up analysis, industry reports, comparable company data |
| Problem severity | Helpful | Customer interviews, survey data, industry pain point documentation |
| Technical capability | Yes for differentiation | Patents, published research, team credentials |
| Competitive positioning | Yes | Feature comparisons, customer feedback, market analysis |
| Revenue projections | Must show assumptions | Unit economics model, comparable growth rates |
| Team claims | No citation, but verifiable | LinkedIn profiles, prior exits, reference-checkable |

**Benchmark:** Federal grants require explicit milestone definitions with quantitative success metrics. NSF reviewer guidance specifically asks "Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?" Applications lacking measurable outcomes represent a top-3 rejection reason.

### Pitch completeness: required elements

**Essential slides based on DocSend/Papermark research:**

1. **Title/Company Purpose** (sets context)
2. **Problem** (establishes urgency—but only gets 11.3 seconds average viewing)
3. **Solution** (10.6 seconds average viewing—be concise)
4. **Why Now?** (third-longest viewing time in 2023; increasing importance)
5. **Market Opportunity** (TAM/SAM/SOM with methodology)
6. **Business Model** (position 4th for success; receives 85% more scrutiny if unsuccessful)
7. **Traction** (receives 110% more scrutiny for unsuccessful decks—make it count)
8. **Competition** (never claim "no competition")
9. **Team** (investors spent **40% more time** on seed team slides in 2024 versus 2023)
10. **Financials** (0% of failed decks included; 58% of successful decks did)
11. **Ask** (specific amount and use of funds)

**Benchmark:** Optimal deck length is **10-15 slides** (Papermark data shows 49% of decks fall in 9-16 page range). Guy Kawasaki's 10/20/30 rule remains validated: 10 slides, 20 minutes, no font below 30pt.

### Materials assembly anti-patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Looks Right | Why It's Strategically Weak |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Polished slides lacking substance | Professional appearance | VCs explicitly cite this as common frustration; substance > style |
| Magic quadrant showing only you check all boxes | Competitive framework | Signals naivety; no one believes you've solved everything |
| Team slide buried at end | Following common templates | At pre-seed, team is 50% of decision; position prominently |
| Exit plan already detailed | Shows strategic thinking | Signals lack of confidence or commitment |
| Hypothetical unit economics | Shows financial sophistication | Pre-revenue projections without validation lose credibility |
| Claiming "well-designed and easy to use" | Standard product positioning | YC: "That is not an insight. You're just claiming you're going to execute well." |

## Phase 12: Funding execution quality standards

The funding execution phase converts prepared materials into submitted applications, active data rooms, and investor engagement. Quality standards vary significantly by funding channel.

### Application quality by funding type

**Grant applications (SBIR/NIH/NSF):**

| Criterion | Scored Weight | What Reviewers Evaluate |
|-----------|--------------|------------------------|
| Technical Approach | Highest predictive value | Well-reasoned methodology with measurable milestones |
| Team Qualifications | Required threshold | Relevant expertise demonstrated, not just claimed |
| Commercial Potential | Explicit criterion | Defined pathway to market with customer validation |
| Innovation | Must clear bar | Novel vs. incremental; "shifting paradigms" language expected |

**NIH Scoring Scale:** 1-9 where 1 is Exceptional and 5 is average. Final impact scores (10-90, where 10 is best) determine paylines. NIAID payline: 29 (SBIR), 31 (STTR). NCI is highly competitive at 4.3% Phase I acceptance.

- **Relevance:** Official NIH reviewer guidance document

**Equity pitches (VC/Angel):**

| Stage | Primary Evaluation Focus | Expected Evidence |
|-------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Pre-seed | Team quality (50%+ of decision) | Founder achievements, domain expertise, coachability |
| Seed | Team + validated problem | MVP/prototype, customer interviews, LOIs |
| Series A | Product-market fit | Revenue traction, unit economics, retention |

**Benchmark:** Kauffman Foundation research found angels who conduct **20+ hours of due diligence** per investment achieve significantly higher returns. The implication: quality applications anticipate and pre-answer due diligence questions.

### Traction highlight standards

**For pre-product ventures, acceptable traction evidence includes:**

- Waitlist signups with conversion/engagement metrics
- Signed Letters of Intent (with specific terms)
- Customer interviews documented with quotes
- Technical milestones achieved (prototype stages)
- Design partner commitments
- Beta user feedback with retention data
- Product Hunt or similar validation signals
- Accelerator backing (serves as credibility signal)

**Good:** "47 enterprise customers on waitlist; 12 signed LOIs totaling $180K committed ARR; average sales cycle 23 days with 3 decision-makers per account"

**Bad:** "Strong interest from potential customers" or "We've talked to 50 people who would buy"

**Benchmark:** Mercury notes: "In the seed stage, early traction gives an investor validation that you have people interested in what you're building. This could look like waitlist signups, letters of intent (LOIs), or your first customers."

- **Relevance:** Practical guidance from startup-focused financial services provider

### Data room readiness standards

**Essential data room components:**

| Category | Required Documents | Quality Markers |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Corporate | Certificate of incorporation, bylaws, operating agreement | Clean, current, professional preparation |
| Cap table | Current ownership, option pool, SAFE/convertible notes | Fully modeled with all instruments; no surprises |
| IP | Patent filings, invention assignments, trademark registrations | All contractors/employees have signed IP assignment |
| Financial | Historical financials, projections with assumptions, bank statements | Numbers consistent across all documents |
| Legal | Material contracts, customer agreements, employment agreements | No undisclosed liabilities or unusual terms |
| Team | Founder agreements, vesting schedules, key employee contracts | Clear roles; no equity disputes; full vesting schedules |

**Anti-pattern:** Messy or unclear cap tables are top-cited due diligence red flags. Missing IP assignment agreements with early contractors create major liability concerns.

### Funding execution anti-patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Looks Right | Why It's Strategically Weak |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Using third party to pitch for you | Professional representation | "Fundraising is the job of a CEO—period, full stop" (VC consensus) |
| 50/50 equity split without rationale | Equal partnership | 3x more likely to have founder disputes; signals avoiding hard conversations |
| Grant application without Letters of Support (NIH Phase II) | Self-contained application | Letters validate commercial interest; expected at Phase II |
| Letters of Support in NSF Phase I | Shows preparation | Automatic rejection—explicitly prohibited at this stage |
| Reading from pitch deck | Prepared presentation | Undermines authenticity; signals lack of internalization |
| Revenue concentration >20% single customer | Shows significant traction | Major risk flag in due diligence |

## Vertical-specific quality variations

### Healthcare/Life Sciences

**Distinctive requirements:**
- Regulatory pathway clarity (FDA, EMA) replaces "go-to-market strategy" in importance
- Clinical validation milestones substitute for revenue traction
- IP portfolio evaluation weighted heavily
- Longer runway expectations (7-10+ years to exit) affect funder targeting
- Angel Capital Association reports healthcare/life sciences now represents **one-third of all angel deals**

**Benchmark:** NIH SBIR success rates vary dramatically by institute—NIEHS Phase I at 29.5% versus NCI at 4.3%. Understanding institute-specific paylines is essential.

## Conclusion: distinguishing complete from strategically sound

The research synthesized here reveals that **quality funding work is methodological, not merely comprehensive**. A capital thesis that lists 100 funders demonstrates effort but signals strategic weakness; 20-40 highly-aligned funders with documented criteria represents sophistication. A pitch deck that includes all standard slides achieves completeness; one that positions business model early, includes financials, and maintains narrative consistency across documents achieves strategic soundness.

For pre-product, pre-revenue ventures specifically, three patterns emerge from the evidence. First, **team credentials bear disproportionate weight**—DocSend reports 40% increased scrutiny on team slides in 2024, and Techstars explicitly states team is "50% of the decision." Second, **stage-appropriate traction substitutes for revenue**—LOIs, customer interviews, technical milestones, and waitlist metrics all count, but vague "strong interest" claims do not. Third, **funder-specific compliance creates binary outcomes**—NSF Phase I rejects applications with Letters of Support; NIH Phase I doesn't require preliminary data. The expert review skill must catch these distinctions between "looks complete" and "strategically positioned for success."

The most actionable finding: investors spend an average of **2 minutes 30 seconds** reviewing pitch decks. Every element must earn its place, and the first page receives 30% more attention than subsequent pages. Quality means front-loading the strongest material and eliminating everything that doesn't advance the funding thesis.
