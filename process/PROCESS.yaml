description: "Capital-first venture creation process"

principles:
  - id: capital-first
    statement: "Start with what funders want, work backwards"
    rationale: "Ventures built to funder criteria survive due diligence by design"

  - id: evidence-backed
    statement: "Every claim must have third-party citation"
    rationale: "If our research and funder due diligence draw from the same sources, they reach the same conclusions"

  - id: customer-voice-from-research
    statement: "Extract customer voice from public sources, not interviews"
    rationale: "AI can mine forums, reviews, and discussions at scale; revenue validates better than interviews"

  - id: traction-before-funding
    statement: "Get revenue before seeking funding"
    rationale: "Funders want proof; $1 of revenue beats promises"

  - id: ai-executes-humans-decide
    statement: "AI performs research and generation; humans review and approve"
    rationale: "Leverage AI for scale, humans for judgment"
