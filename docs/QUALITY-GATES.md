# Quality Gates

Human review checkpoints between each phase. These gates ensure quality and alignment before progressing.

## Gate Philosophy

**Agents research, humans decide.**

Each gate asks a specific question. If the answer is "no," the opportunity either:
- Goes back for revision
- Gets deprioritized in the portfolio
- Gets abandoned (rare, but valid)

---

## Gate 1: Capital → Research

**Question**: "Is this capital source worth pursuing?"

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Amount is meaningful ($100K+ for software ventures)
- [ ] Criteria are clear and achievable
- [ ] Timeline is realistic
- [ ] We have relationship/access to decision makers
- [ ] Terms are acceptable (equity %, control, etc.)

### Decision
- **Approve**: Proceed to find problems matching criteria
- **Revise**: Need more clarity on criteria/terms
- **Decline**: Not worth pursuing

---

## Gate 2: Research → Validation

**Question**: "Is this problem worth solving?"

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Problem is real (3+ third-party sources confirm)
- [ ] Market is large enough (TAM > $100M for venture scale)
- [ ] Pain is acute (not a "nice to have")
- [ ] Matches capital source criteria
- [ ] We can credibly address this space

### Red Flags
- Only 1-2 sources for key claims
- TAM based on assumptions, not data
- Problem exists but isn't painful enough to pay for

### Decision
- **Approve**: Problem validated, proceed to design solution
- **Revise**: Need more evidence or different angle
- **Decline**: Problem not worth pursuing

---

## Gate 3: Validation → Design

**Question**: "Do I believe this evidence?"

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Validation cross-referenced claims
- [ ] Contradicting evidence addressed (not hidden)
- [ ] Assumptions flagged with verification plan
- [ ] Data availability confirmed (we can actually build this)
- [ ] Confidence score > 70

### Red Flags
- Validation just confirmed research without cross-checking
- Major assumptions unaddressed
- Data availability uncertain

### Decision
- **Approve**: Evidence solid, proceed to design
- **Revise**: Need deeper validation on specific claims
- **Decline**: Evidence doesn't hold up

---

## Gate 4: Design → Evidence

**Question**: "Is this solution buildable?"

### Review Checklist
- [ ] MVP scope is realistic (not "boil the ocean")
- [ ] Technical approach is sound
- [ ] Integration strategy respects customer reality (Crawl/Walk/Run)
- [ ] Complexity matches available resources
- [ ] Differentiation is clear

### Red Flags
- MVP has 20+ features
- Requires technology that doesn't exist
- Integration requires customer to change everything
- "We'll figure it out" on key technical challenges

### Decision
- **Approve**: Solution is buildable, proceed to evidence
- **Revise**: Simplify scope or technical approach
- **Decline**: Not feasible to build

---

## Gate 5: Evidence → Competitive

**Question**: "Is every claim sourced?"

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Every statistic has a citation
- [ ] All URLs are accessible and current
- [ ] Sources are credible (not random blogs)
- [ ] Dates are recent (within 2-3 years for most data)
- [ ] Data availability evidence is solid

### Red Flags
- Statistics without sources
- Broken links
- Sources are 5+ years old
- "Common knowledge" claims without evidence

### Decision
- **Approve**: Evidence is bulletproof, proceed to competitive analysis
- **Revise**: Need citations for specific claims
- **Decline**: Can't verify core claims

---

## Gate 6: Competitive → Business Case

**Question**: "Is this positioning defensible?"

### Review Checklist
- [ ] All major competitors identified (not just convenient ones)
- [ ] Differentiation is specific, not generic
- [ ] Positioning backed by third-party evidence
- [ ] Risks surfaced and addressed (not hidden)
- [ ] Honest about our weaknesses

### Red Flags
- "No competitors" claim (almost never true)
- Differentiation is "we're better" without evidence
- Competitors dismissed without analysis
- Risks not mentioned

### Key Question
If a skeptical investor asks "Why won't [Competitor X] just add this feature?", do we have a credible answer backed by evidence?

### Decision
- **Approve**: Positioning is defensible, proceed to business case
- **Revise**: Need stronger differentiation or more honest analysis
- **Decline**: No defensible position exists

---

## Gate 7: Business Case → Customer ID

**Question**: "Would I invest in this?"

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Narrative is compelling and clear
- [ ] All materials are consistent (same stats everywhere)
- [ ] Every claim linked to source
- [ ] Objections addressed proactively
- [ ] Materials are professional quality
- [ ] Ask is clear and reasonable

### The Investor Test
Read the business case as if you're an investor being pitched. Ask yourself:
- Do I understand the problem? (< 30 seconds)
- Do I believe this is a real problem? (Evidence)
- Do I believe this team can solve it? (Credibility)
- Is the market big enough? (TAM/SAM)
- Why hasn't someone else done this? (Differentiation)
- What's the ask and is it reasonable? (Investment)

### Decision
- **Approve**: Would invest, proceed to customer identification
- **Revise**: Strengthen specific sections
- **Decline**: Business case doesn't hold together

---

## Gate 8: Customer ID → Outreach

**Question**: "Are these the right targets?"

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Ideal customer profile matches our solution
- [ ] 20+ qualified prospects identified
- [ ] Pain indicators verified where possible
- [ ] Contact information is current
- [ ] Priority scoring makes sense
- [ ] Mix of "easy wins" and "stretch" targets

### Red Flags
- Prospects don't match ICP
- Contact info is generic (info@company.com)
- All prospects are same type (no diversity)
- Pain indicators are assumed, not verified

### Decision
- **Approve**: Targets are solid, proceed to outreach
- **Revise**: Need better prospects or more research
- **Decline**: No viable customers identified

---

## Gate 9: Outreach → Funding

**Question**: "Is this commitment solid?"

### Review Checklist
- [ ] LOI or contract is signed
- [ ] Terms meet capital source requirements
- [ ] Customer is real (verified organization)
- [ ] Decision maker signed (not junior person)
- [ ] Commitment is specific (not vague interest)
- [ ] Timeline is clear

### LOI Requirements
At minimum, LOI should state:
- Intent to purchase/pilot upon completion
- Specific use case or problem they want solved
- Budget range or pricing expectation
- Timeline for decision
- Named decision maker

### Red Flags
- "Interested" without written commitment
- Signed by someone without authority
- Vague terms ("might consider")
- No timeline

### Decision
- **Approve**: Commitment is solid, activate funding
- **Revise**: Need stronger commitment or better terms
- **Decline**: No viable customer commitment

## Portfolio-Level Reviews

Beyond individual gates, conduct periodic portfolio reviews:

### Weekly Review
- How many opportunities at each phase?
- Any stuck/blocked?
- What needs human attention?
- Resource allocation across opportunities

### Monthly Review
- Conversion rates between phases
- Time in each phase (looking for bottlenecks)
- Quality of outputs (improving or degrading?)
- Lessons learned to feed back into process

### Quarterly Review
- Overall portfolio health
- Funded ventures performance
- Framework improvements needed
- Agent effectiveness assessment
